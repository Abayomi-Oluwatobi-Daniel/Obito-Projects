<h3>Low and Slow</h3>
<i>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</i>
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. </br>In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. 
</br>In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>


<p><b>Location:</b> Baker's Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
<p><b>Hours:</b> Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</p>
